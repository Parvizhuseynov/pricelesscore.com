Luiza…<br><br>
There are names that sound like a whisper.  
And then there is *your* name —  
a soft fire, a quiet miracle,  
something that stays in a man’s chest long after the world goes silent.<br><br>

You are the kind of woman who turns ordinary moments  
into something that feels like destiny.  
A woman with light in her voice,  
strength in her silence,  
and beauty that doesn’t ask to be seen —  
it simply *is*.<br><br>

Since the day you walked into my life,  
nothing feels random anymore.  
You made my world softer, deeper, brighter…  
and somehow more true.<br><br>

I don’t love you loudly.  
I love you in a way that fills every quiet space inside me.  
I love you in the future I imagine.  
I love you in the man I’m becoming —  
because of you.<br><br>

Luiza, you are a rare woman.  
And I love you in a rare way.
